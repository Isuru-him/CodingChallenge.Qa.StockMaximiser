# Introduction 
This project is written to validate the retreive and validate the maximum profit someone can earn on a given set of share price list. 

Inside the logic
There are 2 classes and 1 interface

In the business layer, there is a IMaximiser interface with 2 abstract methods 
and another class called Maximiser

Insde that Maximiser class, one of those abstracted methods called profitMax, has been implemented. 

Inside the test layer, there is a test class called UnitTest1.cs
inside that there are two test methods called, validateMaximumProfit and ValidateZeroProfit respectively. Those two classes are used to validate two separate instances where someone can earn a maximum profit and where the maximum profit is zero for a given set of share prices

# Getting Started

ProfitMax() API is called via UnitTest1.cs classes test methods to execute the tests. 

# Build and Test
Build the code and execute the unit tests to run the code. 

# Contribute
